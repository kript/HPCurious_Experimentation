## Synopsis


Using a combination of Vagrant and Ansible, this builds a `Vagrant machine that runs a Wordpress server.
This assumes you're running a single server with a domain name directly to Wordpress, anything more
complex you're welcome to fork.

## Motivation

I wanted something to rapidly prototype wordpress sites, test plugins and site designs.

## Installation

run by editing _playbook.yml_ and editing the domain variable to be the same of the site. 


## License

Released under the Apache licence.
